# Language_Flashcard
a flashcard to learn French (but you can change the CSV to any language you want)
you can find the language source from https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/tree/master/content/2018
and use google sheets to translate the language you want to English, then download 
to CSV and the sky is the limit.
